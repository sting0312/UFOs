# UFOs

## Overview of Project
This project focuses on building a webpage that displays information about UFO sightings.
Yuo are able to filter the UFO sightings table based on multiple criteria such as the event date, city, state, country and shape.

## Results
On the left side of the webpage, you can enter information in any/all of the filters to sort the results.
There is a return to home button on the top left of the nav bar.

##Summary
One drawback is the lack of a drop down/ display of information in order to know how or what to fiter by.
You could either have a small table at the top showing cities/states, shapes, etc.
You could also have a drop down menu on some of the filter text boxes to auto fill information into the fiter boxes.
